# Phase-1 of Lockdown Analysis in Delhi, Maharastra and Kerala [25.03.2020 - 14.04.2020]

**Hello Readers**,<br /> 
This project is a part of Assignment-4 of Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python course on Coursera, This MOOC is by the University of Michigan, In this project, I have used the concepts learned from This course.
The data used in this project is taken from 'Dataset on Novel Corona Virus Disease 2019 in India' uploaded on Kaggle by 'sudalairajkumar'.

**The Dependencies of this project can be installed on your system using 'PIP' command**,
You can use google colab or jupyter notebook to open the .ipynb file mentioned in this project. You will need to install dependencies to run the .ipynb file via jupyter notebook through localhost.

**NOTE - This project doesn't intend to question government authorities, We are collectively responsible for the increase in the COVID-19 cases**


**It would be of great help if the government has provided the increase in healthcare services designated for COVID-19 before and after the Phase-1 of lockdown this data would make an analysis of efficiency of lockdown phase-1.**

## Data Visualised in this project- 
1. Change in the number of COVID-19 Cases in India during the 21 days of Lockdown Phase-1. 
2. Change of number of COVID-19 Cases in Maharastra, Kerala, and Delhi during the 21 days of Lockdown Phase-1.
3. Percentage of COVID-19 cases in various age groups.

_You can choose any state or union-territory of your choice by cloning this repository and creating a dataframe of the respective stare or UT_
